# Easy paper reader extension
In the process of delving into neuroscience papers, I find myself navigating through multiple tabs for various purposes - one dedicated to figures, another for methods, a separate one for references, and one specifically reserved for in-depth reading of the text. This extension serves as an endeavor to streamline this multitasking load into a more seamless and organized experience." 

## While reading paper, 
1. Highlight the figure number to see the figure

2. Highlight methods word to see Methods
